Bleh's Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing

## !!! WIP !!!
This repository contains an implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing where shares are protected using Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and verified via EDDSA. Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic technique that allows a secret to be divided into shares, which can then be distributed among a group of participants. The original secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of shares are combined.
ECIES is used to securely encrypt and decrypt the shares, adding an extra layer of security to the Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme.
EDDSA is a verification mechanism to verify the validity of the data.

#### Goals

[x] - ECIES X25519 implementation
[x] - SSS implementation
[-] - Unit tests
[-] - Simple CLI to test functionality
[-] - ...
